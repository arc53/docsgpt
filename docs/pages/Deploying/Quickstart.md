## Launching Web App
**Note**: Make sure you have Docker installed

**On macOS or Linux:**
Just run the following command:

This command will install all the necessary dependencies and provide you with an option to use our LLM API, download the local model or use OpenAI.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arc53/DocsGPT.git
   cd DocsGPT
   ```
2. Create a `.env` file in your root directory and set the env variables.
   It should look like this inside:

   ```
   LLM_NAME=[docsgpt or openai or others] 
   API_KEY=[if LLM_NAME is openai]
   ```

   See optional environment variables in the [/application/.env_sample](https://github.com/arc53/DocsGPT/blob/main/application/.env_sample) file.
   
3. Run the following commands:
   ```bash
   docker compose up
